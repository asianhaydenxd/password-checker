            <h2>The Purpose of Password Requirements</h2>
            <p>In the eyes of a website, the only thing distinguishing you from a hacker is your password.
               It's important to make sure that no hacker can guess your password.</p>
            <p>To prevent hackers from stealing accounts, many websites opt to force users to comply with
               a specific set of rules for the security of passwords. This reduces the chance of users
               having their accounts stolen.</p>
            <p>The requirements these websites typically set include (but are not limited to):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Password length</li>
                <li>Capital letters</li>
                <li>Numbers</li>
                <li>Symbols</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These requirements have been provided below to test whether or not your own passwords are 
               up to these websites' standards.</p>
            <h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
            <p>Whether you're well-known or not, you are still capable of being the victim of a hacker. Hackers may go
               after whoever they are capable of going after, and if you're not careful, you could be one of them.</p>
            <p>You may not think that being hacked is much of a deal, and sometimes it isn't. However, when a hacker
               manages to break into your account, they are able to access all of your information on the respective
               site. And if you share that password across all your accounts, they would be able to access all of the
               information you've put online.</p>
            <p>No matter how confident you are that you'll be fine, it's much better to be safe than sorry in the end.</p>
